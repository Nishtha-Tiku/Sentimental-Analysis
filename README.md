# Sentimental-Analysis
The main motive behind this project was to construct a sentiment analysis model that will help us to get a better understanding of movie reviews that we have collected. We compared the results of the 3 classifiers - Naïve Bayes, SGDC (Stochastic Gradient Descent), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor and Random Forest Classifier. For Evaluation, we observed the accuracy provided by each model. By evaluating the models, we found out that Logistic Regression gives us the highest accuracy score of 85.45%.
The dataset is retrieved from Kaggle. The labeled data set consists of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews, specially selected for sentiment analysis. The sentiment of reviews is binary, meaning the IMDB rating < 5 results in a sentiment score of 0, and rating ≥7 have a sentiment score of 1. No individual movie has more than 30 reviews. The 25,000 review labeled training set does not include any of the same movies as the 25,000 review test set. In addition, there are another 50,000 IMDB reviews provided without any rating labels.
